# lightbulb-problem-solving
A short click through adventure in problem solving

Created as an activity to help introduce my CS students to debugging. Through this activity, students learn they're already familiar with several "debugging" strategies such as trial and error and process of elimination. Later activities will build on this one, asking more open-ended questions to help students mentally abstract the debugging process.
